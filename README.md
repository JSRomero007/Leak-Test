# **Description**:

Development of software for the visualization and analysis of data in a leak testing system that applies positive pressure to electrical connectors. The software generates graphs of the recorded information, enabling better interpretation of connector behavior and detection of potential failures during integrity testing.

# **Challenges and Solutions**:

The main challenge of this project was to make the leak test data easily visualizable and storable. To address this, the software was developed to graphically represent the information in real time, allowing for better analysis of connector behavior. Additionally, a database integration was implemented to store and manage the test data, ensuring traceability and easy access for future analysis.

# **Role and Responsibilities**:

Sole developer responsible for the design and implementation of the software for data visualization and database integration in the Leak Test system. The role involved optimizing real-time data representation and ensuring efficient storage for future analysis.
